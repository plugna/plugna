== Description ==
With Plugna, you can manage your plugins in a fun and easy way. It's a plugin manager that is built on top of the original WordPress plugins page, so you can switch back to the original plugins page whenever you need it.

* **AJAX-BASED**: No page loads, page refreshing, and no more waiting for actions to finish up
* **LESS SCROLLING**: See more plugins on place without scrolling
* **EASY FILTERING**: Filter plugins by keywords, statuses or criteria like: activated, deactivated, having updates, etc.
* **TOGGLE ACTIVATION**: Select and toggle multiple plugins' state at once (active -> inactive and inactive -> active)


= FEATURES =
Plugna contains most of the features that WordPress plugins' manager has, but with improved user experience.
You can always switch back to the original plugins page whenever you need it.
