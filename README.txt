== Description ==
**Plugna** is a WordPress plugin that simplifies the management of other plugins. It provides a single page for managing all plugins on your website, allowing you to easily activate, deactivate, update, or delete plugins, as well as install and activate new plugins - all without having to refresh the page.

Plugna is built on top of the original WordPress plugins page, to reuse its complexity and security but with the improved user experience.

You can switch back to the original plugins page whenever you need it.
